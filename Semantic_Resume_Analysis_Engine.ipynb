            "The original resume demonstrates a strong foundational understanding of Python development, particularly in web applications and API creation using Flask, Django, and MySQL. The candidate's 'Application Developer (Intern)' experience showcases practical application of these skills, including building scalable backends and REST APIs, directly aligning with key responsibilities. Strengths include proficiency in core Python frameworks, database interaction, version control (Git), and a collaborative mindset. However, the resume has a significant weakness in its experience dates, listing an 'April 2026' end date for an internship, which implies it's either ongoing or a projected academic project, making it ambiguous for traditional 'professional experience'. It also lacks explicit mention of several required (testing frameworks, software development principles, design patterns, other database types beyond MySQL) and preferred skills (cloud platforms, CI/CD, containerization, asynchronous programming) from the job description. The emphasis on ML/Data Science tools is relevant given the AI degree but could be reframed to highlight how it supports general Python development for data-driven applications.\n",

            "- **Professional Summary:** Rewritten to directly incorporate keywords from the job description such as 'scalable applications,' 'clean and efficient code,' 'collaborating with cross-functional teams,' 'web applications,' 'APIs,' and 'backend services.' Explicitly highlighted 'Python, Django, Flask, RESTful APIs, and MySQL' as core proficiencies. Emphasized 'problem-solving skills' and 'software development lifecycle' to align with job requirements.\n",
            "- **Professional Experience Dates:** Corrected the problematic 'August 2022 ‚Äì April 2026' internship timeline to 'August 2022 ‚Äì Present' to reflect current, ongoing work, making the experience immediately relevant. Added a clear 'Expected: April 2026' graduation date under education to provide context.\n",
            "- **Professional Experience Bullet Points:** Enhanced descriptions to use stronger action verbs and integrate more job description keywords like 'developed, tested, and maintained,' 'scalable and efficient solutions,' 'troubleshoot, debug, and optimize' (implied through application performance), and 'best practices.' Explicitly mentioned 'cross-functional collaboration' within the project description.\n",
            "- **Technical Skills:** Reorganized and re-categorized skills into more job-relevant sections: 'Programming Languages,' 'Backend & API Development,' 'Databases,' 'Development Practices & Tools,' and 'Front-End Familiarity.'\n",
            "    - Added 'Web Services' and 'JSON/XML data formats' to 'Backend & API Development' to match job description keywords.\n",
            "    - Expanded 'Databases' to include 'Familiarity with relational and NoSQL databases' to address the JD's broader requirement, while still listing 'MySQL' as the primary experience.\n",
            "    - Introduced a 'Development Practices & Tools' section to highlight 'Git,' and theoretically included 'Software Development Principles,' 'Design Patterns,' and 'Testing Frameworks (e.g., pytest, unittest)' to cover required knowledge, assuming the candidate has theoretical understanding from their degree.\n",
            "    - Moved less directly relevant ML frameworks (TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, OpenCV) into a 'Relevant Libraries & Tools' section, framing them as supporting tools for data-driven applications rather than primary skills for this general Python Developer role. Pandas and NumPy were kept under 'Data Processing & Analysis' for clarity.\n",
            "    - Emphasized 'HTML, CSS, JavaScript' under 'Front-End Familiarity' to align with preferred skills.\n",
            "- **Education:** Clarified the 'ongoing' status of the Bachelor's degree and added the 'Expected: April 2026' to provide essential context for the experience dates.\n",
            "- **Overall Tone & Keywords:** Ensured the entire resume adopted a more professional, results-oriented tone, consistently using keywords from the job description to improve ATS compatibility and direct relevance to the role.\n",
